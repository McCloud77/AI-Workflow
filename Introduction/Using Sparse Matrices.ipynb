    "Once a well-trained machine learning model has been deployed, the data ingestion pipeline for that model will also be deployed. That pipeline will consist of a collection of tools and systems used to fetch, transform, and feed data to the machine learning system in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, that pipeline cannot be finalized during the development of the machine learning model it feeds. Finalizing the process of data ingestion before models have been run and your hypotheses about the business use case have been tested often leads to lots of re-work. Early experiments almost always fail and you should be careful about investing large amounts of time in building a data ingestion pipeline until there is enough accumulated evidence that a deployed model will help the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of building a complete data ingestion pipeline, data scientists will often use sparse matrices during the development and testing of a machine learning model. Sparse matrices are used to represent complex sets of data (e.g., word counts) in a way that reduces the use of computer memory and processing time."
